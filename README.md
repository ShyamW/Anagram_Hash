# Anagram Hash
Java MVC Swing Gui that hashes scrambled words into a product on prime integers. 

The algorithm assigns each alphabetical letter a prime number and then multiplies all prime numbers to assign a scrambled word a hash value. This alorithm is O(n) in worst case, and is far faster than using maps or dictionaries to store letters and frequencies.

Currently: The program hashes scrambles

Future Plans: The program will hash a scramble and then provide suggested unscrambled words
